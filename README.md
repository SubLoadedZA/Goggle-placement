## What is this for?
This is a Machine learning Repository which mainly focuses on predecting the human face using npm package ```@tensflow/blazeface```. 

## Models and technologies used.

BlazeFace is a lightweight and well-performing face detector tailored for mobile GPU inference. It runs at a speed of 200-1000+ FPS on flagship devices. This super-realtime performance enables it to be applied to any augmented reality pipeline that requires an accurate facial region of interest as an input for task-specific models, such as 2D/3D facial keypoint or geometry estimation, facial features or expression classification, and face region segmentation
